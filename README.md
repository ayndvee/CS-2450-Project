# CS-2450 Project

# macOS Compatibility
If you're using macOS, you'll need to install the tkmacosx package to ensure proper button styling and full theme support, as native macOS buttons may not respect color settings.

Install it with:
```
pip install tkmacosx
```

The app will still run without it, but certain visual elements (like button colors and borders) may not appear as intended on macOS without this package.



## Running the Program
Run the program from the src folder.
The program can be run in two different ways:
1. From the Command Line
2. From a GUI

## 1. Command Line

```
python main.py <filename>
```

or

```
python main.py <filepath>
```

## 2. GUI
```
python main.py
```

Once the GUI is up an running you will then be able to input the file and test it out.


### Example
File in the same directory:
```
python main.py Test1.txt
```

#### File Path Example
Full file path for text file:
```
python main.py /c/Users/name/Documents/Test1.txt
```

Relative path from project root:
```
python ./UVSim-Project/src/main.py Test1.txt
```


Also make sure that the program you want to run is a BasicML program.
