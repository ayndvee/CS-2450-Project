- Regroup on Friday to discuss our ideas and what we can do moving forward.

# Professor Notes
Talk about how this one is a smaller section so now is the time to work on solidifying how the code works and make sure we are following Software Engineering principles.
We might want to focus on refactoring some code to follow the Model View Controller framework, to make things have looser coupling.
