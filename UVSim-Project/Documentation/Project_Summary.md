# Retrospective Summary

This project was a collaborative effort to build the UVSIM simulator to read BasicML instructions. It allowed us to work as a team to implent the needed features for handling memory, running the CPU, and creating a interactive GUI to show the simulation. We designed it using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to help keep things organized and more maintainable. Throughout the process we tried to follow software design principles to help us learn about them while also improving our project.

## Performance

The final product of the project runs smoothly with minimal stutters, even when given larger instruction amounts. The UVSIM regularly executed the programs as expected and our error handling caught most edge cases. We validated and tested most of the core functionality through unit testing. This gave us confidence to know that our main components such as instruction execution, memory reading/writing, and I/O handling were working as we expected them to. While using the GUI, it remained responsive, and all the buttons and widgets worked as intended. Although this version of UVSIM is designed for educational purposes, the MVC architecture used allows for the ability for it to be expanded easily. Overall the program is stable, responsive, and loads and resets programs quickly. This reflects the effort we took in designing, organizing, and testing our code throughout the project.

## Future Road Map

To enhance the UVSim project beyond its current capabilities, several impactful features can be implemented. Introducing symbolic labels and a simple assembler would allow users to write programs using readable labels and variable names instead of raw opcodes and addresses, making development and debugging significantly easier. Adding execution breakpoints, memory watch functionality, and cycle counters would improve debugging and help users visualize how instructions affect memory over time. An interactive opcode tester could provide a hands-on way to explore instruction behavior in isolation, which is especially useful for beginners. Expanding the instruction set with conditional branching, stack operations, and indirect addressing would unlock more complex programming possibilities and align UVSim more closely with real-world low-level architectures. Finally, creating a plugin system for opcode handlers and optionally offering a web-based interface would future-proof the simulator and improve accessibility across platforms.
